<p><strong>Why won&#8217;t ConocoPhillips talk with us?</strong> On 6/15/06, we called ConocoPhillips with a win-win plan to save and preserve some select 76 Balls. We are still waiting for them to call back. Maybe they need to hear from <strong>you</strong>, too. The main number in Houston is 281-293-1000. Ask for <strong>Sylvia Hansen in External Communications</strong> and request that she call Nathan Marsak back and open a dialogue about how to work together to turn this bad publicity around and save some balls.</p>
<p><strong>About our cause:</strong> ConocoPhillips is removing the iconic 76 Balls and replacing them with boring rectangular signs that aren&#8217;t even orange! Our petition and boycott asks that they STOP THIS and leave the remaining 76 Balls on their poles, where they belong. Wanna help?:</p>
<p>1) sign the <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/76ball/petition.html" target="_blank">PETITION</a>; after adding your name to the list, you can also call ConocoPhillips <a href="http://www.conocophillips.com/contactus/index.htm" target="_blank">DIRECTLY</a>.</p>
<p>2) Join the digg online community and click that you &#8220;digg&#8221; <a href="http://digg.com/software/Can_Drupal_Save_the_76_Ball_" target="_blank">THIS POST</a>. If we can get enough diggs, the topic will rise to the front page and get many thousands of visitors.</p>
<p>3) if your local 76 gas station still has its ball, tell them &#8220;if that ball goes, so does this customer!&#8221; Ask them to turn the ball on if it&#8217;s not lit or rotating. And if your local 76 station has already switched to the liver-colored tombstone sign, don&#8217;t buy gas there and be sure to tell the owner why. (<a href="http://plasticmuse.com/Download.html" target="_blank">DOWNLOAD</a> and print these cards to make it simple.)</p>
<p><img src="http://savethe76ball.honestbleeps.com/files/savethe76card_168.jpg" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p>4) SPREAD THE WORD: through blogs, email chains, conversation, calls to your favorite talk radio show and letters to the editor.</p>
<p>5) visit our <a href="http://savethe76ball.honestbleeps.com/" target="_blank">FORUM</a> to report existing or missing 76 Balls in your community. Take photos and host them for free right on the Forum.</p>
<p>Consumers have the power to change corporate mistakes. ConocoPhillips will listen if you just speak up!</p>

								<p>There is little doubt that the 76 ball is a California icon.  However, while perserving icons is important, it crucial that we do so in a way that recognizes the history associated with those icons.  In this way, we must not save the 76 ball without recognizing the horrific human rights abuses committed with the support of this company.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Unocal contracted with the Burmese army to provide security during the construction of a new pipeline.  Under the watch of Unocal and with Unocal&#8217;s knowledge, the Burmese army systematically murdered, raped, and forced people to work.  Unocal recently paid some victims for damages.</p>
<p>While one could conceivably argue that the 76 ball had nothing to do with murder, rape and slavery, it represents a company that was complicit in these atrocities.  I urge you to consider this in your campaign.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Amber Norris<br>
Washington, DC</p>

								<p>1) ConocoPhillips does not own the 76 Brand, they are only the national marketer.  If you want to fix this, you must contact Unocal/Chevron and convince them to reassert their ability to do the 76 Marketing.</p>
<p>2) There are still 76 stations that will not be switching to the lame red circle, many 76 stations are still under contract with Unocal not CP, these stations don&#8217;t even appear on CP&#8217;s website.  Regardless of what CP does, the 76 ball will survive at these stations.</p>

								<p>While Chevron owns the 76 brand for exploration and production, they do not own the 76 brand for marketing and refining.  Unfortunately Conoco Phillips owns the 76 logo and name for all downstream marketing and refining operations, including service stations. .  What is happening now is that Conoco Phillips is  replacing the orange ball logo at all Union 76 stations that it directly owns and operates.  It supplies all the other Union 76 stations, but those that are dealed owned and operated are under no immediate pressure to replace the 76 logo.  My understanding though is that Conoco Phillips will no longer supply replacements for 76 Orange Balls that wear out and need replacing.  </p>

								<p>I am sure you can dig up dirt on any company. Our interest in saving the Ball signage, and has nothing at all to do with the company, what it is or what it was.   I doubt there isn&#8217;t anyone who really cares about Union Oil, Phillips, or Conoco unless they work there. It is the trademark sign we want to save that has been part of lives, and OUR AMERICAN HISTORY for decades.  We have seen many great American Companies change hands, or go out of business altogher. May great logos are now gone.  He must hold on to what is left of our great Amercian Company History.<br>
 Phillips/Conoco will on longer replace the aging balls for dealers that want to keep them, yet they will spend millions changing out signage,that doesn&#8217;t need replacement, and repaing stations,changing colors that don&#8217;t need a change. Seems some young exec is trying to make a name for himself.  What an idiot.  Probably some kid that got into the company because his father works there.<br>
The ball is one of the, of not the best logo around. Remember the antenna balls. What great advertising!  No other company has had such a unique, versatile logo. Every other logo ends up as a bumper sticker.  I hope the big wigs at Conoco Phillips open their eyes,get some balls, and fire the guy who came up with this change. If it aint&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it!  Save your balls!</p>

								<p>I&#8217;m a former 76 dealer from Southern California. I have owned 4 different stations and managed 3 others since the early 80&#8217;s. </p>
<p>The ball was first introduced at the Worlds Fair in December of 1962 and the response was so good that they decided to use it at stations. My station (#5027) was the first to get the rotating ball. I was not the dealer then, but I do have the 76 Magazine cover page from March of 1963 showing the new look and it is of my station in Redondo Beach. </p>
<p>It lasted until October 31st, 2001 when it was removed. The oil company decided that the station had no longer been profitable and decided to close it. The station &#038; the pole are still there, but the fence around it shows it&#8217;s closed. (1870 S. Elena Ave, Redondo Beach)</p>
<p>I have all the history of the antenna ball on my website at:<br>
<a href="http://www.osbornauto.com/76balls.htm" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.osbornauto.com/76balls.htm</a> if you are interested. The information was compiled from many sources, including Fred Hartley, a past CEO of Union Oil who was around during those years. </p>

								<p>One of my fave memories was listening to Vin Scully do the commentary on Dodger baseball during summer vacation. Union Oil was a sponsor, although I barely realized it at the time. But I still remember the jingle, and in case you don&#8217;t, it went like this:<br>
&#8220;You always get the finest<br>
The very best, the finest<br>
At the sign of the 76<br>
Whether you stop in for water or air<br>
To powder your nose or comb your hair.<br>
You always get the finest<br>
The very best, the finest<br>
At the sign of the 76.<br>
It&#8217;s orange and blue,<br>
So look for that Union<br>
Sign of the finest &#8212;<br>
The sign of the 76.&#8221;</p>

								<p>Having been born and raised in NJ, I&#8217;ve only spotted The Ball firsthand on a road trip out west 20 years ago, but I remember watching stock car races on tv as a kid and recall that the Ball was installed at some of the tracks. I always thought it looked cool, it&#8217;s just an eye-catching and attractive device. I don&#8217;t know how much fruit this campaign will bear but I wish you all the best. Hacky in NJ<br>

								<p>I&#8217;ll miss seeing that orange ball slowly revolving in the sky. Come to think of it, do they still revolve? I&#8217;ve only seen the static ones recently. A lot of communities now have rules against signs like the 76 ball. Perhaps it&#8217;s just a sign of the times? Hmmm.</p>

								<p>NASCAR got rid of all the 76 balls at the tracks when Sunoco took over the fuel supply for them.

The 76 station on the corner of Brea Boulevard and Rosecrans Avenue, their 76 ball does not even rotate. Seeing that rotating 76 sign would cheer my day up. I am behind your cause 100%.</p>

								<p>     It took a couple of trips past the &#8220;76&#8221; station at Moraga &#038; Sepulveda for me to fully register &#8220;what was DIFFERENT, WRONG?&#8221; . . . the orange signage darkened to cheerless, somber, RED&#8230;  What on earth ,  why??  I am surprised and glad to learn that others are disappointed and  even angry.  &#8220;76&#8221; is losing its bright, glowing, optimistic visual appeal to a somber, sterile, ordinary image , which is no fun to look at, and in fact, more difficult to see.<br>

								<p><b><u>Thanks greatly</u></b> for reading this.  I&#8217;m a logo-designer/graphic-designer&#8230;antique-car artist&#8230; gas-station/country-store artist&#8230;Disney-style character-designer&#8230;(despite living in Appalachian, N.W. Alabama&#8230;not greater L.A.)&#8230;and Christian soc. work volunteer&#8230;who had submitted the petition, which accused ConocoPhillips of &#8220;cowardice.&#8221;   Yes, <b><i>cowardice</i></b>&#8212;for having been <u>silent</u> to the press.  Until <u>very</u> recently&#8230;and then, <i>only</i> in the form of a (rather evasive) written statement.   I can&#8217;t STAND that in a corporate business!&#8230;unless a lawsuit is involved.   That&#8217;s bad enough for any corporate action which hurts historic preservation; what if a corporation refuses to comment on <b><i>human-rights abuses</i></b> which its name is connected with?      But more about <u>that</u> in another E-mail, another day&#8230;. </p>
<p>   This E-mail is not important; it&#8217;s just that I found information on the way by which Union Oil arrived at her famous &#8220;76&#8242; trademark.  Even though <i>this</i> road-map collector wasn&#8217;t around before 1964&#8230;you know, Union Oil used &#8220;76&#8221; numerals <u>decades before</u> they glued &#8217;em to styrofoam balls, soccer balls, or wall-mounted, Plexiglas, &#8220;contact-lenses.&#8221;  In fact&#8230;the navy-blue &#8220;76&#8221; numerals (on an orange background) weren&#8217;t even the <b><i>first</i></b> Union Oil logo!   Turns out that a corporate executive, who had recently emigrated to the States, became fascinated with American history&#8230;and that <b>his</b> suggestion coincided with the then-octane-rating of Union Oil&#8217;s all-new, Ethyl grade.  That was back in <i>1932!</i></p>
<p>According to <b><i><u>The 76 Bonanza</u></i></b> (Lane Magazine &#038; Book Co., 1966), Earl M. Welty &#038; Frank J. Taylor wrote thus:  &#8220;For many years, the familiar trademark of Union Oil was a striped shield.&#8221;  (p.203)  &#8220;To free their retail outlets from ruinous, price-war competition, the Union refineries gave them a gasoline they could <i>talk</i> about&#8230;an improved motor fuel of the highest octane, or anti-knock, rating&#8230;at the time.  The marketing department decided that (it)&#8230;should have a distinctive name.   After spirited discussions, (a Union executive-meeting)&#8230;decided upon <b><i>&#8220;76&#8221;</i></b>&#8212;the suggestion of Robert D. Matthews, (a) persuasive young Welshman, who had been boning-up on American history (in order) to qualify for his citizenship-papers.&#8221;  (Paraphrased &#038; re-punctuated from pp. 202 &#038; 203.)   </p>
<p>The Company&#8217;s wholehearted acceptance of its new corporate symbol, alas, didn&#8217;t bring <i>immediate</i> success for <i>everybody.</i>   The &#8220;76&#8221; logo neither propelled Robt. Matthews himself to the presidency of Union oil.  Nor did the U.S. Patent-Office immediately recognize it!  </p>
<p> As far as the <b><i>former,</i></b> surprising consequence:  Sadly, it seems like Matthews was <i>much</i> better at accounting than he must have been at, say, consensus-building (or possibly at being a &#8220;people-person&#8221; of <i>any</i> sort)<b>.</b><br>
Robert Matthews (first hired as a young comptroller in 1913&#8230;coincidentally, when retail &#8220;fillin&#8217; stations&#8221; just started) had risen steadily since then&#8230;to become Union Oil&#8217;s Executive V.P. by 1936.  (See p. 206.)   Evidently, however, &#8220;&#8230;Matthews developed a flair for high-handed operation, frequently ignoring the president and the executive committee completely.  These tactics, resented by his associates, doomed Matthews&#8217; dream of (someday) becoming Union&#8217;s president.&#8221;  (Paraphrased from p. 206.)  Evidently, cliques also developed within Unocal&#8217;s upper-management (coincidentally, in the Depression&#8217;s sharp return of 1937)&#8212;and Matthews led one of these cliques.   </p>
<p>(Antique-auto, tractor, or truck, &#038; performance-car-collectors who will visit this site&#8212;esp. Fomoco-collectors&#8212;<i>might</i> recall <i>other</i> famous &#8220;fissures&#8221; within corporate halls of power.  Specifically, those which involved <i>another</i> accountant named &#8220;Robert&#8221;: Bob <u>McNamara</u>, the &#8220;bean-counter&#8221; among Henry Ford II&#8217;s &#8220;Whiz Kids&#8221; of 1945-&#8217;46.   Yes, cliques DID develop among McNamara&#8217;s accountants&#8230;with Lee A. Iacocca&#8217;s Engineering guys, Marketing men, and dealer-network men&#8230;with the horsepower-lovin&#8217; &#8220;car-guys&#8221;&#8230;<i>and</i> with George Walker&#8217;s Styling Dept. (both of whom eventually gave us the 1955 Thunderbird &#038; 1955-&#8217;56 Lincoln Continental), &#038;c., &#038;c<b>.</b>  According to both Iacocca&#8217;s 1986 autobiography <i>and</i> a later, Ford-family biography by David Horowitz, Henry Ford II <u>loved</u> to play one Executive V.P. off another.   However, I am <i>unaware</i> of whether or not Unocal&#8217;s management &#8220;fissures&#8221; of 1936-&#8217;37 were as <i>serious</i> as, say, Fomoco/Dearborn&#8217;s cliques, 20 yrs. later.   <i>Those</i> would hurt Ford Division &#038; Ford Tractor dealers&#8212;and esp. Lincoln/Edsel/Mercury dealers!&#8212;by the recession of 1957-&#8217;58.)  </p>
<p>Returning to Union Oil, and to 1937<b>:</b>  In the end, it was a former steel-executive&#8230;one <u>Reese H. Taylor</u>&#8230;who became Union Oil&#8217;s president, and later corporate C.E.O. (Probably because he had led Unocal&#8217;s <i>heroic</i> contributions to the Allies, during World War II.)<br>
        If you&#8217;re a magazine-collector like myself: It was Taylor who gave birth to the Company&#8217;s once-famous ads, which announced: &#8220;America&#8217;s <u>Fifth</u> Freedom is Free-<u>Enterprise</u>.&#8221;   (Oh, <b><i>yeah?</i></b>)   It seems that Taylor spent six, seven months in Washington in 1942&#8230;and the experience <i>infuriated</i> him.  &#8220;Businessmen have so much trouble in Washington, primarily because&#8230;government-people don&#8217;t understand what makes business function.&#8221; (See pp. 218, 219).  (Taylor&#8217;s observation sounds odd to <i>me.</i>  Business-lobbies <b><i>seem</i></b> to be successful at getting Congressional ears&#8230;as well as V.P. Dick Cheyney&#8217;s ears&#8230;enjoying successes that educational, human-rights, scientific, &#038; religious lobbies are <u>still</u> dreaming, hoping, &#038; aching for.)  Anyway, Taylor commissioned a series of ads which explained how free-market capitalism &#8220;benefitted everybody,&#8221; esp. through one industry&#8230;and one Corporation.  To Unocal&#8217;s <u>great</u> credit, the Company did help-out &#8220;little guys&#8221;&#8212;small, bulk-plant-jobbers, jobber-owned stations, &#038; dealer-owned country-stores (and tiny, wholesale-suppliers to the Company itself)&#8212;when <i>they</i> ran out of dough (pp. 219, 231-233).<br>
         Today, since those ads (in Glorious Black-&#038;-White) neither announced Royal 7600 gas, nor Royal Triton motor oil, they usually command under $5.00 in today&#8217;s flea-markets (and on eBay).   But in 1943&#8211;the public liked them so much (and they eventually <i>did</i> move <b>so</b> much product!) that Unocal used this basic format into 1964. </p>
<p><b><i>Oops!</i></b>  Speakin&#8217; of advertising&#8230;back to the &#8220;76&#8221;<b>:</b>  Back in 1932, six state-capitals&#8212;in Oregon, Wash. St., Idaho, Nevada, &#038; Arizona, as well as Calif.&#8212;<u>did</u> register Union&#8217;s orange-&#038;-blue logo.   You&#8217;re right: all were within the Company&#8217;s marketing-area.   But<b>:</b> &#8220;&#8230;the (U.S.) Patent-Office <i>rejected</i> it; on the grounds that &#8220;76&#8221; <i>might</i> be construed as the <i>octane</i>-rating&#8230;and hence (that &#8220;76&#8221;) could <i>not</i> be the <i>exclusive</i> property of Union Oil.&#8221; (See p. 203; italics mine.)  Unocal probably tried for years; not until <i>1950</i> did the U.S. Patent-Office <u>finally</u> certify &#8220;one of Union&#8217;s most valued, if intangible, assets.&#8221; (Also p. 203.)</p>
<p>As for the facelifts?  Union Oil dressed its &#8220;76&#8221; into ast least three facelifts before the one we&#8217;re familiar with.   By 1933, the orange/navy &#8220;76&#8221; was first used on the once-famous Union Oil shield. (Remember seeing this on replicated-pump decals?)   Then, by 1935, in neon, atop Unocal&#8217;s gorgeous white towers (with twin canopies that announced &#8220;Stop-Wear Lubrication&#8221;).   Then, by 1939, on a striped, orange rectangle&#8230;often wired for neon itself!   Sometime between 1947 &#038; the official U.S. Govt. patent of 1950, the orange background finally compressed into its now-famous disc-shape.   (By then&#8230;years before the 1965 mega-merger&#8230;Unocal began to market Triton &#038; Royal Triton motor-oils to motorists east of the Rockies; see p. 230.)  &#8220;UNION&#8221; in tiny, white lettering was added later, like an afterthought. (Except for the now-famous canopy signs, often called <i>&#8220;boulevard signs,&#8221;</i> used on company-owned stations by 1955.)<br>
      They must have seemed an afterthought to retail motorists!  In 1962, Union Oil&#8217;s V.P. (of Refining &#038; Marketing) enlarged the &#8220;UNION&#8221; block-letters and streamlined the &#8220;76&#8221; numerals &#8220;after a poll revealed that a good many patrons were referring to Union Oil Company as &#8216;the 76 Company.'&#8221; (p. 271)<br>
 That man&#8212;one <u>Fred L. Hartley</u>&#8212;had developed the Company&#8217;s patented &#8220;Unifining&#8221; process.   Basically, Unifining made petroleum distillates from so-called &#8220;sour crude&#8221; (heavy sulfur?) as pure as those from the &#8220;light sweet crude&#8221; you hear about on financial-news broadcasts.   And refined &#8217;em faster than any competitor could do in the mid-1950s!  (See page 249.)   So, <i>other</i> petro-giants paid Unocal <i>huge</i> royalties to <i>license</i> the Unifining process in <i>their</i> refineries, too.<br>
      After 1959&#8230;when then-chairman Reese Taylor invited Hartley to become Executive V.P. of Refining &#038; Marketing&#8230;Hartley applied this same genius to retail-marketing.   It was during the early 1960s that Union Oil constructed the L.A. Dodgers baseball-park gas-station, that some of you fellow &#8220;bloggers&#8221; have mentioned.  (And a giant, storage &#8220;baseball&#8221; at one of their refineries, too!)   The Union Oil Foundation followed in 1962 (see p. 277)&#8230;finally bringing the Company into the civic &#038; charitable-donation field throughout Alaska, Hawaii, and other states west of the Rockies.<br>
    So, President (and later C.E.O.) Fred Hartley had as much to do with applying the &#8220;76&#8221; to an orange sphere as Ray Pedersen did.   (Even though I&#8217;m proud to be in Mr. Pedersen&#8217;s line of work!)   Because of <b><i><u>The 76 Bonanza&#8217;s</u></i></b> publishing-date (again, 1966), it <i>never</i> mentioned the late-1960&#8217;s facelift&#8230;76&#8217;s last&#8230;until recently.  (Regardless of your opinion or mine, about that <i>red</i> color!)    Was that the giant Young &#038; Rubicam, who facelifted the &#8220;76 meatball&#8221; around 1968?<br>
  In any event, I might have been only five when the Plexiglas, 76 &#8220;contact lenses&#8221; and fiberglass discs began to replace Pure Oil discs, here in N.W. Alabama.   (And Pure Oil was one of my two favorite brands to feature in doodles of country-stores, as a toddler.  The older, pre-1957, Pure disc was one of my two favorite brands to cut out of road-maps and to &#8220;keep,&#8221; as I do today with chrome-emblems, plastic-signs, &#038; early road-maps themselves.)   However&#8212;while I was five&#8212;my <i>very first</i> attempt at either cartooning <i>or</i> graphic-design was a &#8220;storyboard&#8221; of a T.V. commercial.  What did it tease the public about?   Why, those &#8220;76&#8221; antenna balls, of course!    </p>
<p>37 years since 1969, I&#8217;m ex-TREME-ly happy that Unocal (or ChevronTexaco) <b><u>did</u></b> talk to the press about atrocities in Burma. (Please see Amber Norris&#8217; splendid comment, on behalf of <a href="http://www.earthrights.org/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.earthrights.org</a>.)   Because&#8212;as (I <u>hope</u>) a born-again Christian&#8212;I <u>thoroughly</u> share Mr. Norris&#8217; concern.  Very soon, I plan to thank him personally in a &#8220;Reply.&#8221;<br>
Later, to the rest of you: I have <i>two</i> more questions to ask about the original creators of <i>some</i> &#8220;76&#8221; facelifts, from what I&#8217;ve read in the past.   Also, I&#8217;m still trying to gather research (esp. on current preservation efforts) about gas/oil collectors&#8217; <i>and</i> historic preservationists&#8217; <b>closest</b> counterpart to &#8220;Save the &#8217;76&#8217; Balls,&#8221; east of the Missouri River: Pure Oil&#8217;s white/navy &#8220;cottages.&#8221;   <b><u>Please</u></b> remember, <i>all</i> of you: I&#8217;m looking <u>everywhere</u> for a hard-acrylic, &#8220;Union 76&#8221; disc, embossed &#038; wall-mounted, originally from a 1960s&#8217; &#8220;ranch-house&#8221; station.  (Whether, today, it&#8217;s from a sign-company&#8217;s warehouse, or a jobber&#8217;s warehouse, or a flea-market!)   Those of us who specialize in collecting &#038; trading plastic-<u>only</u>, gas/oil signs (<i>only</i> some five to ten of us across USA) aren&#8217;t doing NEARLY as much as Mr. Marsak&#8217;s &#038; Mrs. Cooper have done.  <b><u>These two</u></b> deserve ALL our thanks&#8230;our <b><i>biggest</i></b> thanks!</p>

								<p>Those photos of the 76 station on Oahu bring tears to my eyes! I was born and raised in Honolulu and we always used to fill up at that exact 76 station. As a kid, the big orange ball was a comfort to me. I used to have a big collection of bright, orange 76 antenna balls.</p>

								<p>Thanks greatly for reading this<b>.</b>    Am that visual-artist (and soc<b>.</b> work volunteer<b>,</b> usually in Art Therapy &#038; Music therapy)<b>,</b> from N.W. Alabama<b>&#8230;</b>where we&#8217;ve seen <i>our</i> share of Unocal-76 <b>&#8220;</b>contact lenses<b>.&#8221;</b>  Yes<b>,</b> and even a few balls<b>,</b> too<b>,</b> after 1969!</p>
<p>    <b>&#8220;</b>You mean you ain&#8217;t no convenience-store manager? digital-pump installation &#038; repair place?  car &#8216;n truck repairman?   <i>They&#8217;re</i> th&#8217; usual gas-station-antiques-collectors!<b>&#8220;</b>       Don&#8217;t get me wrong<b>;</b> they&#8217;re all REAL men (<u>and</u> women<b>,</b> also!)<b>&#8230;</b>and I <b><i>admire</i></b> those blue-collar people<b>.</b>    Remember<b>,</b> though<b>,</b> that graphic-layout<b>&#8230;</b>corporate-identity<b>&#8230;</b>antique-car illustrations<b>&#8230;</b>landscapes of pre-1975 gas-stations<b>,</b> country-stores<b>,</b> &#038; car/truck dealerships<b>&#8230;</b>these <i>all</i> make up a <u>large</u> portion of my work<b>,</b> and I <i>still</i> want to <u>break free</u> of rural Alabama<b>,</b> to study both auto-design and animation<b>.</b>   (If I can ever <i>afford</i> graduate-school!)  </p>
<p>     <b>Why I explained my work:</b>  Am <u>still</u> looking for advice on <b><u>how to E-mail</u></b> your <b><u>snapshots &#038; artwork</u></b> to <b><i>this</i></b> blog-site<b>.</b>   Oh<b>,</b> Mrs<b>.</b> Cooper &#038; Mr. Marsak have asked for both submissions, all right&#8212;but<b>,</b> sadly, neither of them told us the <b><i>steps,</i></b> the <b><i>technique</i></b> by which to do just that&#8212;when an Internet toolbar has <b><u>no</u></b> <b>&#8220;</b>Attach<b>&#8220;</b> paper-clip symbol<b>.</b>    (I&#8217;ve been told that <u>this toolbar symbol</u> enables you to E-mail visuals that you <b>&#8216;</b>d once saved in <b>&#8220;</b>My Documents<b>&#8220;</b> or <b>&#8220;</b>My Pictures<b>.&#8221;</b>)   </p>
<p>Remember that&#8211;as I&#8217;d stated in early August&#8211;we <i>now</i> have snapshots of<b>&#8230;</b>well<b>,</b> practically Easterners<b>&#8216;,</b> Midwesterners<b>&#8216;,</b> &#038; Southeasterners&#8217; counterpart to 76-ball preservation<b>,</b> <i>viz.<b>:</b></i> <b>Pure Oil&#8217;s navy-roofed, white &#8220;cottages,&#8221;</b> from 1927 into W<b>.</b> W<b>.</b> II<b>.</b>   (Those which have survived<b>,</b> that is!)  Just for good measure, I  included an ee-NOR-mous, 76 &#8220;contact-lens&#8221;&#8212;double-sided, with fluorescent bulbs&#8212;in the outdoor-yard of a fellow-pop-culture-collector (who&#8217;s trying to sell it)<b>.</b>  </p>
<p>Since Fayette&#8217;s Arts/Crafts/Music Festival kept me busy for <i>five months</i>(until last Saturday afternoon)<b>,</b> I sadly regret that I have no finished, completed, Union Oil-related artwork&#8230;either inked <i>or</i> completed in watercolors<b>.</b>   Meantime<b>,</b> among my snapshots of past-canvasses (for Fayette Arts Festivals since 2000)&#8212;I <b><i>do</i></b> have two, Pure Oil/Woco-Pep country-stores<b>;</b> one of them closed-down with the 1970s&#8217; fuel-shortages<b>.</b>  Fortunately, the second one has benefitted from Pure Oil&#8217;s comeback after 1992<b>;</b> as a weak marketer<b>,</b> perhaps<b>&#8230;</b>but as a &#8220;comeback-kid,&#8221; nonetheless!  </p>
<p>A <b><u>little later on</u>&#8230;</b>now that the Arts Festival is (<u>whew</u>!) FINALLY over (and since I design characters in the MGM/Warners/Disney <b>&#8220;</b>squash-&#038;-stretch<b>&#8220;</b> and <b>&#8220;</b>anticipatory-action<b>&#8220;</b>)&#8230;I hope to incorporate a &#8220;Save the 76 Ball&#8221; theme <i>within</i> one of my inked-samples<b>,</b> of my proposed comic-strip<b>,</b> <b><i><u>Pack-Rat</u>,</i></b> intended for antiques-collectors&#8217; magazines<b>.</b>   Remember<b>,</b> too<b>,</b> that I have a series of twenty-four, gas-station watercolors<b>&#8230;</b>from which I print hand-signed<b>,</b> color-photocopies on business-card stock<b>.</b>  When my twenty-sixth watercolor is FINALLY complete<b>&#8230;</b>I&#8217;ll present <u>that</u> to all of you<b>,</b> also!   It showcases a white<b>,</b> Art Moderne/Art Deco<b>,</b> &#8220;Union Oil Dealer&#8221; station&#8211;with its <b>&#8220;76&#8221;</b> tower soaring 40 feet into space.     Among the vehicles who pull-up for service, are two trucks<b>:</b> One reads &#8220;Paramount News;&#8221; the other truck (for a local radio-repair-shop) advertises <b>&#8220;</b>Columbia Graphophones &#038; Radios<b>.&#8221;</b><br>
   This watercolor is one of my <i>very few</i> attempts at <b>1920s&#8217; animation</b>-type cartooning<b>,</b> such as Nicktoons (you know; Viacom, MTV, CBS, Simon &#038; Schuster, and all that) recently  used for <u><b><i>My Life as a Teenage Robot</i></b></u>.  Even the two truck-drivers &#038; gas-pump-jockeys will be inside-jokes of Nicktoons &#038; Frederator personnel!   Now<b>,</b> it&#8217;ll take me a few months to complete (little-by-little<b>,</b> off-&#038;-on)<b>&#8230;</b>so I <i>hope</i> to please all of you!<b>&#8230;</b> </p>
<p><u>Whew</u>!  Yeah<b>,</b> I <b><i>am</i></b> a <b><i>little</i></b> curious about tips on E-mailing photos &#038; artwork to blog-sites like this fine, splendid Web-site<b>&#8230;</b>from <b><i>any</i></b> member who knows <b><i>how&#8230;.</i></b></p>
<p><b><u>Thank you all</u></b> in advance, for putting-up with my <b><i>wordiness!</i></b>  <u>Please</u> forgive me for it<b>.</b>  Don&#8217;t Mrs<b>.</b> Cooper &#038; Mr<b>.</b> Marsek deserve admiration &#038; thanks from <b><u>all of us</u>?</b>   In the meantime<b>,</b> I&#8217;ve two more things to ask all of you&#8212;but I&#8217;d better wait until later<b>,</b> this long weekend.   My attempts to get this &#8220;HTML&#8221; correct have simply taken <i>too long</i> (just like this E-mail!) and I do have five<b>,</b> small<b>,</b> collector-car watercolors to complete<b>,</b> for a specialty-car-collector from industrial-Pennsylvania.  A friendly guy with a brass, &#8220;GULF&#8221; disc (once screwed onto Bennett pumps from 1937-&#8217;41)&#8212;with my name on it!<br>
<b>And</b> both photocopies &#038; snapshots to mail<b>,</b> to staff-members of both (A.)Alabama&#8217;s <u>only</u> &#8220;petroliana&#8221; swap-meet<b>&#8230;and</b> (B.)our state&#8217;s <u>only</u><b>,</b> animation fans&#8217;/cartoonists&#8217;/&#8221;furry-fandom&#8221; convention<b>.</b>  If <i>only</i> (sigh!) they biologically<b>,</b> genetically<b>,</b> <u>really</u> existed!<b>&#8230;</b> </p>

								<p>Have I dropped into Short Attention Span theater? It has not been all that long ago when Unocal was in court trying to explain why they weren&#8217;t responsible for the slave labor the brutal government of Myanmar (aka as Burma) used to build an oil pipeline Unocal had a major interest in. The government of Myanmar dragooned entire villages along the length of the pipeline and forced them to do backbreaking manual labor at the point of a gun. Men, women, and children died on that pipeline project. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, that ball represents the worst of America&#8217;s amoral corporations. They have blood on their hands.</p>

I'm a logo-designer\/graphic-designer...antique-car artist... gas-station\/country-store artist...Disney-style character-designer...(despite living in Appalachian, N.W. Alabama...not greater L.A.)...and Christian soc. work volunteer...who had submitted the petition, which accused ConocoPhillips of \"cowardice.\"   Yes, <b><i>cowardice<\/b><\/i>---for having been <u>silent<\/u> to the press.  Until <u>very<\/u> recently...and then, <i>only<\/i> in the form of a (rather evasive) written statement.   I can't STAND that in a corporate business!...unless a lawsuit is involved.   That's bad enough for any corporate action which hurts historic preservation; what if a corporation refuses to comment on <b><i>human-rights abuses<\/b><\/i> which its name is connected with?      But more about <u>that<\/u> in another E-mail, another day.... \r\n\r\n\r\n   This E-mail is not important; it's just that I found information on the way by which Union Oil arrived at her famous \"76' trademark.  Even though <i>this<\/i> road-map collector wasn't around before 1964...you know, Union Oil used \"76\" numerals <u>decades before<\/u> they glued 'em to styrofoam balls, soccer balls, or wall-mounted, Plexiglas, \"contact-lenses.\"  In fact...the navy-blue \"76\" numerals (on an orange background) weren't even the <b><i>first<\/b><\/i> Union Oil logo!   Turns out that a corporate executive, who had recently emigrated to the States, became fascinated with American history...and that <b>his<\/b> suggestion coincided with the then-octane-rating of Union Oil's all-new, Ethyl grade.  That was back in <i>1932!<\/i>\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to <b><i><u>The 76 Bonanza<\/b><\/u><\/i> (Lane Magazine & Book Co., 1966), Earl M. Welty & Frank J. Taylor wrote thus:  \"For many years, the familiar trademark of Union Oil was a striped shield.\"  (p.203)  \"To free their retail outlets from ruinous, price-war competition, the Union refineries gave them a gasoline they could <i>talk<\/i> about...an improved motor fuel of the highest octane, or anti-knock, rating...at the time.  The marketing department decided that (it)...should have a distinctive name.   After spirited discussions, (a Union executive-meeting)...decided upon <b><i>\"76\"<\/b><\/i>---the suggestion of Robert D. Matthews, (a) persuasive young Welshman, who had been boning-up on American history (in order) to qualify for his citizenship-papers.\"  (Paraphrased & re-punctuated from pp. 202 & 203.)   \r\n\r\nThe Company's wholehearted acceptance of its new corporate symbol, alas, didn't bring <i>immediate<\/i> success for <i>everybody.<\/i>   The \"76\" logo neither propelled Robt. Matthews himself to the presidency of Union oil.  Nor did the U.S. Patent-Office immediately recognize it!  \r\n \r\n As far as the <b><i>former,<\/b><\/i> surprising consequence:  Sadly, it seems like Matthews was <i>much<\/i> better at accounting than he must have been at, say, consensus-building (or possibly at being a \"people-person\" of <i>any<\/i> sort)<b>.<\/b>\r\nRobert Matthews (first hired as a young comptroller in 1913...coincidentally, when retail \"fillin' stations\" just started) had risen steadily since then...to become Union Oil's Executive V.P. by 1936.  (See p. 206.)   Evidently, however, \"...Matthews developed a flair for high-handed operation, frequently ignoring the president and the executive committee completely.  These tactics, resented by his associates, doomed Matthews' dream of (someday) becoming Union's president.\"  (Paraphrased from p. 206.)  Evidently, cliques also developed within Unocal's upper-management (coincidentally, in the Depression's sharp return of 1937)---and Matthews led one of these cliques.   \r\n\r\n(Antique-auto, tractor, or truck, & performance-car-collectors who will visit this site---esp. Fomoco-collectors---<i>might<\/i> recall <i>other<\/i> famous \"fissures\" within corporate halls of power.  Specifically, those which involved <i>another<\/i> accountant named \"Robert\": Bob <u>McNamara<\/u>, the \"bean-counter\" among Henry Ford II's \"Whiz Kids\" of 1945-'46.   Yes, cliques DID develop among McNamara's accountants...with Lee A. Iacocca's Engineering guys, Marketing men, and dealer-network men...with the horsepower-lovin' \"car-guys\"...<i>and<\/i> with George Walker's Styling Dept. (both of whom eventually gave us the 1955 Thunderbird & 1955-'56 Lincoln Continental), &c., &c<b>.<\/b>  According to both Iacocca's 1986 autobiography <i>and<\/i> a later, Ford-family biography by David Horowitz, Henry Ford II <u>loved<\/u> to play one Executive V.P. off another.   However, I am <i>unaware<\/i> of whether or not Unocal's management \"fissures\" of 1936-'37 were as <i>serious<\/i> as, say, Fomoco\/Dearborn's cliques, 20 yrs. later.   <i>Those<\/i> would hurt Ford Division & Ford Tractor dealers---and esp. Lincoln\/Edsel\/Mercury dealers!---by the recession of 1957-'58.)  \r\n\r\nReturning to Union Oil, and to 1937<b>:<\/b>  In the end, it was a former steel-executive...one <u>Reese H. Taylor<\/u>...who became Union Oil's president, and later corporate C.E.O. (Probably because he had led Unocal's <i>heroic<\/i> contributions to the Allies, during World War II.)  \r\n        If you're a magazine-collector like myself: It was Taylor who gave birth to the Company's once-famous ads, which announced: \"America's <u>Fifth<\/u> Freedom is Free-<u>Enterprise<\/u>.\"   (Oh, <b><i>yeah?<\/b><\/i>)   It seems that Taylor spent six, seven months in Washington in 1942...and the experience <i>infuriated<\/i> him.  \"Businessmen have so much trouble in Washington, primarily because...government-people don't understand what makes business function.\" (See pp. 218, 219).  (Taylor's observation sounds odd to <i>me.<\/i>  Business-lobbies <b><i>seem<\/b><\/i> to be successful at getting Congressional ears...as well as V.P. Dick Cheyney's ears...enjoying successes that educational, human-rights, scientific, & religious lobbies are <u>still<\/u> dreaming, hoping, & aching for.)  Anyway, Taylor commissioned a series of ads which explained how free-market capitalism \"benefitted everybody,\" esp. through one industry...and one Corporation.  To Unocal's <u>great<\/u> credit, the Company did help-out \"little guys\"---small, bulk-plant-jobbers, jobber-owned stations, & dealer-owned country-stores (and tiny, wholesale-suppliers to the Company itself)---when <i>they<\/i> ran out of dough (pp. 219, 231-233).  \r\n         Today, since those ads (in Glorious Black-&-White) neither announced Royal 7600 gas, nor Royal Triton motor oil, they usually command under $5.00 in today's flea-markets (and on eBay).   But in 1943--the public liked them so much (and they eventually <i>did<\/i> move <b>so<\/b> much product!) that Unocal used this basic format into 1964. \r\n\r\n<b><i>Oops!<\/b><\/i>  Speakin' of advertising...back to the \"76\"<b>:<\/b>  Back in 1932, six state-capitals---in Oregon, Wash. St., Idaho, Nevada, & Arizona, as well as Calif.---<u>did<\/u> register Union's orange-&-blue logo.   You're right: all were within the Company's marketing-area.   But<b>:<\/b> \"...the (U.S.) Patent-Office <i>rejected<\/i> it; on the grounds that \"76\" <i>might<\/i> be construed as the <i>octane<\/i>-rating...and hence (that \"76\") could <i>not<\/i> be the <i>exclusive<\/i> property of Union Oil.\" (See p. 203; italics mine.)  Unocal probably tried for years; not until <i>1950<\/i> did the U.S. Patent-Office <u>finally<\/u> certify \"one of Union's most valued, if intangible, assets.\" (Also p. 203.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the facelifts?  Union Oil dressed its \"76\" into ast least three facelifts before the one we're familiar with.   By 1933, the orange\/navy \"76\" was first used on the once-famous Union Oil shield. (Remember seeing this on replicated-pump decals?)   Then, by 1935, in neon, atop Unocal's gorgeous white towers (with twin canopies that announced \"Stop-Wear Lubrication\").   Then, by 1939, on a striped, orange rectangle...often wired for neon itself!   Sometime between 1947 & the official U.S. Govt. patent of 1950, the orange background finally compressed into its now-famous disc-shape.   (By then...years before the 1965 mega-merger...Unocal began to market Triton & Royal Triton motor-oils to motorists east of the Rockies; see p. 230.)  \"UNION\" in tiny, white lettering was added later, like an afterthought. (Except for the now-famous canopy signs, often called <i>\"boulevard signs,\"<\/i> used on company-owned stations by 1955.)   \r\n      They must have seemed an afterthought to retail motorists!  In 1962, Union Oil's V.P. (of Refining & Marketing) enlarged the \"UNION\" block-letters and streamlined the \"76\" numerals \"after a poll revealed that a good many patrons were referring to Union Oil Company as 'the 76 Company.'\" (p. 271)   \r\n That man---one <u>Fred L. Hartley<\/u>---had developed the Company's patented \"Unifining\" process.   Basically, Unifining made petroleum distillates from so-called \"sour crude\" (heavy sulfur?) as pure as those from the \"light sweet crude\" you hear about on financial-news broadcasts.   And refined 'em faster than any competitor could do in the mid-1950s!  (See page 249.)   So, <i>other<\/i> petro-giants paid Unocal <i>huge<\/i> royalties to <i>license<\/i> the Unifining process in <i>their<\/i> refineries, too. \r\n      After 1959...when then-chairman Reese Taylor invited Hartley to become Executive V.P. of Refining & Marketing...Hartley applied this same genius to retail-marketing.   It was during the early 1960s that Union Oil constructed the L.A. Dodgers baseball-park gas-station, that some of you fellow \"bloggers\" have mentioned.  (And a giant, storage \"baseball\" at one of their refineries, too!)   The Union Oil Foundation followed in 1962 (see p. 277)...finally bringing the Company into the civic & charitable-donation field throughout Alaska, Hawaii, and other states west of the Rockies.\r\n    So, President (and later C.E.O.) Fred Hartley had as much to do with applying the \"76\" to an orange sphere as Ray Pedersen did.   (Even though I'm proud to be in Mr. Pedersen's line of work!)   Because of <b><i><u>The 76 Bonanza's<\/u><\/i><\/b> publishing-date (again, 1966), it <i>never<\/i> mentioned the late-1960's facelift...76's last...until recently.  (Regardless of your opinion or mine, about that <i>red<\/i> color!)    Was that the giant Young & Rubicam, who facelifted the \"76 meatball\" around 1968?   \r\n  In any event, I might have been only five when the Plexiglas, 76 \"contact lenses\" and fiberglass discs began to replace Pure Oil discs, here in N.W. Alabama.   (And Pure Oil was one of my two favorite brands to feature in doodles of country-stores, as a toddler.  The older, pre-1957, Pure disc was one of my two favorite brands to cut out of road-maps and to \"keep,\" as I do today with chrome-emblems, plastic-signs, & early road-maps themselves.)   However---while I was five---my <i>very first<\/i> attempt at either cartooning <i>or<\/i> graphic-design was a \"storyboard\" of a T.V. commercial.  What did it tease the public about?   Why, those \"76\" antenna balls, of course!    \r\n\r\n37 years since 1969, I'm ex-TREME-ly happy that Unocal (or ChevronTexaco) <b><u>did<\/b><\/u> talk to the press about atrocities in Burma. (Please see Amber Norris' splendid comment, on behalf of www.earthrights.org.)   Because---as (I <u>hope<\/u>) a born-again Christian---I <u>thoroughly<\/u> share Mr. Norris' concern.  Very soon, I plan to thank him personally in a \"Reply.\"\r\nLater, to the rest of you: I have <i>two<\/i> more questions to ask about the original creators of <i>some<\/i> \"76\" facelifts, from what I've read in the past.   Also, I'm still trying to gather research (esp. on current preservation efforts) about gas\/oil collectors' <i>and<\/i> historic preservationists' <b>closest<\/b> counterpart to \"Save the '76' Balls,\" east of the Missouri River: Pure Oil's white\/navy \"cottages.\"   <b><u>Please<\/b><\/u> remember, <i>all<\/i> of you: I'm looking <u>everywhere<\/u> for a hard-acrylic, \"Union 76\" disc, embossed & wall-mounted, originally from a 1960s' \"ranch-house\" station.
