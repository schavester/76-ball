<p>A couple of days ago, I was interviewed on Dori Monson&#8217;s KIRO Seattle radio show about the Save The 76 Ball <a href="https://www.petitiononline.com/76ball/petition.html" target="_blank">petition</a> campaign. Hundreds of Dori&#8217;s listeners have rallied to sign the petition, including Dori himself (thanks!). But the most extraordinary thing to come from this interview was an email I received from Ray Pedersen, a man with a very personal relationship to the 76 Ball. Well, let&#8217;s let him tell you about it himself:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br> Kim: &nbsp;It&#8217;s a small world. &nbsp;A friend of mine and fellow alumni of The Art Center School of Pasadena told me you were on a program the other day and sent me this info on you. &nbsp;I am the guy who was creative director in 1955 on the Union Oil account for Young and Rubican Advertising in L.A. &nbsp;I designed the ball for the Seattle World Fair (their SkyRide) and it was so stunning that Fred Hartley wanted it done for all Union Oil Stations. &nbsp;He called it &quot;Pedersen&#8217;s Balls.&quot;&nbsp; It was much fun. &nbsp;I had a small one made so it would just fit in my Beechcraft Bonanza and we went all over the country shooting beautiful scenes and put the ball up on a pole and what do you know?&#8230;. a gas station in front of the magnificent Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, San Francisco Bay Bridge, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br> Here is a snap of me getting the ball ready at the Grand Canyon location. </p>
<p>Save my ball! &nbsp; (have a housefull plus a basketball with the logo) </p>
<p>Regards,<br> Ray Pedersen</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more from Ray, who is still creatively active at 80, and off to Iceland to brand glacial water for Icelandia PLC!&nbsp;</p>

								<p>Your story has made it to England 🙂 I live here in the UK, and visit California regulary. I am lucky enough to have one of the little 76 balls for my car. The west coast would not be the same without the prominent 76 balls. I wish you every success with your very worthy campaign.</p>

								<p>Europe is roused &#8211; we&#8217;ve seen how your faceless corporate leaders in the USA have eroded your independence, told you 76 is flat, and coldly cut down your balls. &#8211; and we will not stand by and let this happen.<br>
We may have our occasional differences, but we realise our cousins in the USA need all the support they can get to win this battle.<br>
Here&#8217;s one Brit who pledges his vacation money (I&#8217;m there in July) will be spent in any other petrol station but 76 &#8211; unless it has a big orange ball over the forecourt.<br>

								<p>The 76 ball is one of those things that you&#8217;d see in films and tv from the States.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I took a bus trip from Las Vegas to Los Angeles.  On one of our scheduled stops, I took a great pic of the sun setting right beside the 76 ball and it will always remind me of a great holiday.</p>
<p>The 76 ball is an icon.  Maybe not as recognisable as McDonald&#8217;s golden arches, but still something people know and associate with the west coast.</p>
<p>Why take something that&#8217;s just a little bit different and replace it with the same old, same old, bland, homogenised blah flat signage?</p>
<p>Now this campaign has made it to Ireland.  It&#8217;s a global phenomenon!  Maybe the powers that be will see that they&#8217;ve got something special here and decide to keep it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping, huh?</p>

								<p>When visiting California I have used 76 as the gas station of choice, ever since one let me have a baseball in the 76 colours and a &#8220;ping-pong&#8221; ball for my car aerial, which is quite a rarity here in the UK! The 76 balls, like the Denneys signs are great symbols of USA motoring and should be retained.</p>

								<p>What kills me is how we are deliberately destroying or dismantling everything that is or was ever creative about our society. What the hell is going on? We&#8217;re using the same damned space shuttle that was developed in the 1970s; the Routemaster bus is being replaced with bland  boxes; the world-renown red phone boxes were replaced with horrid plexiglas receptacles. It&#8217;s almost as if we don&#8217;t invent anything anymore, and want to destroy anything unique that was created and replace it with something more lazy and boring. The only thing we have left is Apple.</p>
<p>Bring back the ball, build a spaceship to Mars, build a better Concorde (because we can and because there are ways to make it profitable)&#8230; LIVE a worthwhile life, damn it. </p>
<p>&#8230;and use gigantic fiberglas emblems or mascots for simple eating establishments once again.</p>

								<p>I&#8217;m happy to see this going on. While it seems a little silly to crusade after a 76 ball, I guess, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not the only one who was disappointed when the one in my hometown got tossed a few years ago, when Pelham was &#8216;moving up&#8217;, as it were. Corporate streamlining of American culture is the reason we&#8217;re losing what culture we have today, and I&#8217;m very glad to see our European friends caring about this one issue so much as well. </p>

								<p>Ok, maybe the 76 ball is not beautiful, but honestly, how many roadside neon signs really are?  At least this one has style and originality.  And if millions of people had these little things on their car antennas, then why the heck would a company choose to destroy the original?  Obviously they&#8217;ve got something going for them, something that sets them apart from the others.  Removing these signs will only relegate 76 gas stations to the mundane world of the Exxons, Chevrons, and all the others.  The company is shooting itself in the foot &#8211; unless of course it hopes business at 76 stations will go down as a result, and they&#8217;ll be able to just rebrand them all or close some down in markets where they compete with other stations they already own.  Who knows what&#8217;s on those Texan minds?</p>

								<p>From the 50s to now, the Union 76 orange ball was a sign of quality in gasoline. I still carry a Union credit card after 35 years. The orange ball is as Southern California as the Bob&#8217;s Big Boy Burger sign in the San Fernando Valley, or the Hollywood sign. Keep it up!<br>

								<p>Need I say more than. It is not your company. It is not government owned it is their logo/property and has nothing to do with any of you. Every company makes their own decision&#8230; if you dont like it buy the shares and get your say&#8230;.</p>
<p>Lets rebuild the Hindenberg&#8230;It didnt work but stood for a lot and was well known. I also would like to see the first lightbulbs come back. Although they lasted mere minutes they were traditional and stood for something.</p>

								<p>I agree; this is conservatism for the sake of it. Innovation and improvement means change. Put your 76 ball in a museum if you want, but let the company move on so that it may improve its operations, to the benefit, afterall, of its consumers.</p>
<p>This campaign reminds me of the Coca Cola flavour change; indeed flavour enhancement (blind tests showed that it was markedly better). It was due simply to ultra-conservatism, based on wanting to keep old Coke just because it always had been that Coke was prevented from improving its product for the customers.</p>

								<p>I don&#8217;t understand why marketing executives feel the compulsion to throw away years of brand identity like this.  Corporations change &#8220;image&#8221; like I change underwear.  It&#8217;s a waste of money and I think it can backfire.  Remember when Holiday Inn changed their signs&#8211; who stays at Holiday Inn anymore?  Was it worth it?</p>

								<p>If there is one issue of paramount importance to humanity, this is it.  The entire global economy should be put toward prolonging the existence of an orange ball. Work should begin immediately on studying how we can help the orange ball survive beyond the end of the universe. Maybe we&#8217;ll need to create another universe and somehow transfer the orange ball into that existence. Maybe that&#8217;s happened already?  Maybe in a previous universe someone created this universe for the orange ball and now it falls to us to do the same, maybe that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re all here?</p>

<p>I think you are really onto something here.  I believe that God gets a little smile everytime he looks down and spots a bright orange 76 Ball&#8230;  And to think I was getting the impression you were a wannabe intellectual criticizing his/her fellow beings on this planet just because they enjoy the orange ball.</p>

								<p>If the city of Dallas can keep the red pegasus as a symbol of the city after Magnolia Oil or was it the Humble Oil company became Mobil which now merged to become ExxonMobil, then for Pete&#8217;s sake why can&#8217;t ConocoPhillips which has now bought Unocal, aka Union 76, keep their balls?

								<p>I&#8217;m swedish but have spent many a christmas with relatives in LA, a city short on history but big on iconography of wich the 76 ball is a crucial part.<br>
LA would simply not be LA if not for the wonderfully gaudy and camp billbords, signs, movietheaters and classic publicity gimmics like the 76 ball. Just like the Hollywood sign, Manns Chinese Theater, and the hotdog shaped hotdog stand the 76 ball is kitsch but it is part of what makes LA such a unique cityscape.</p>
<p>May your worthy fight against those tampering corperate bigshots at Conoco be as succesfull as the fight to save classic coke. This pointless willfull attempt to distroy an icon of americana and replace it with what a bland sign in a misguided attempt at modernisation just makes me so angry. It is an example, albeit not of the same magnitude, of the same lack of respect for classic symbols and art as the pointless distruction of the giant buddahs of Bamiyan by the Taliban.</p>
<p>Just south of Stockholm a huge 76 ball has pride of place at the freeway exit to the Mantorp racetrack home of the Swedish Formula 1 GP such is the standing of this symbol among motor afficionados many a thousand miles from it&#8217;s balmy smoggy home. May you prevail in your fight to save it in it&#8217;s &#8220;natural habitat&#8221;</p>

								<p>I had never seen a 76 ball in person until my first cross country motorcycle trip in 1995. &#8220;The Ball&#8221; holds no special significance for me, but IF IT AIN&#8217;T BROKE, DON&#8217;T FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why must there be change just for the sake of change?

								<p>The drudgery of city drive and routine of gas fuelling need some brightening up.<br>
I can&#8217;t imagine driving through the city without seeing these cheery orange balls. The marketing execs advising ConocoPhillips should know that the 76 balls are brand icons that scores so high on visibility (you can&#8217;t miss seeing the orange balls!) , recall (the ball and 76 go together like thanksgiving and turkey), and overall brand quotient. </p>
<p>Keep the 76 orange balls lit up!</p>

<p>Give good old fashioned customer service and the novelty and the warm fuzziness of a familiar icon will bring people in droves!Not only that, but iconic signs bring in tourism; people arrive to an area, and look for the easily recoginisable signs and logos. What next&#8230;.replace the Hollywood sign?!</p>

								<p>Just a quick note to wish you all the best on your worthy plight! Whoever thought about ditching something of such iconic value and history to America &#8211; and from a business standpoint, good kudos &#038; brand value &#8211; should have their head examined.

								<p>Just read about your campaign &#8211; I&#8217;d seen these in movies but didn&#8217;t know they were under threat. It would be a shame to lose something so distinctive in favour of a new symbol which looks like any other sign. Why would they give up such a distinctive brand? It seems spiteful they&#8217;re not even letting people keep balls as souvenirs. When British Telecom, similarly foolishly, ditched its world-famous red phone boxes they at least let people buy them. I doubt the company will admit they&#8217;re wrong but maybe they&#8217;ll preserve a few in certain historic places. </p>

								<p>It&#8217;s great that actor Michael Madsen is supporting this campaign, and also buying an old red London phonebox to preserve at his home:<br>
<a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5055782.stm" rel="nofollow ugc">https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5055782.stm</a></p>
<p>You Americans need all the history and culture you can get!!!    ;-]</p>
<p>Seriously, though, I see Mr Madsen idolises Humphrey Bogart and Robert Mitchum, and looks back to a lost age of cinema, too. I say to him: Why not follow in the footsteps of these great actors and play Philip Marlowe in a new series of Raymond Chandler adaptations? Perfect casting and ideal for raising your profile for worthy campaigns such as this.<br>

<p>I would like to therefore add my weight to this campaign to keep this American icon.  As a frequent visitor to LA I will be boycotting any gas station (including Union) WITHOUT one of these 76 balls.</p>

								<p>i bet the company decide to announce they are going to keep the ball.<br>
with the whole world made completely aware of them, and america rejoices, and people in their droves use this company more now, because they feel they have done somthing nice.<br>
and the marketing director, smuggly sits back knowing this quirky campaign and website was a genius idea, recieves a meaty pay check, and plans his next big sting with another company.<br>
or do i have the mind of an evil genius?</p>
