<p>A year after we first asked them to reconsider their destroy all balls policy, ConocoPhillips has agreed to give some 76 Balls to museums. We applaud this wonderful news. But we still would like to see a few select orange and blue 76 Balls allowed to remain on their poles, like the 1965 modernist station by William Pereira in Beverly Hills, or one of the stations along Highway One in Malibu. And designer Ray Pedersen deserves to be able to keep one of his classic balls. If you agree: </p>
<ol>
<li>please sign our <a href="https://www.petitiononline.com/76ball/petition.html" target="_blank">petition</a></li>
<li>tell your local station owner to keep his 76 Ball lit and spinning if he wants to keep your business</li>
<li>call ConocoPhillips in Houston at 281-293-1000, ask for Sylvia Hansen in External Communications, and let her know you want to see a few historic orange and blue 76 Balls stay on their poles, and for designer Ray Pedersen to get one 76 Ball of his own.</li>
<li>visit our <a target="_blank" href="https://savethe76ball.honestbleeps.com/">message board</a> to report existing or missing 76 Balls in your community. Take photos and host them for free right on the message board. </li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 76 Ball was designed by Ray Pedersen, Union Oil&#8217;s ad executive at Young and Rubicam Agency, for the 1962 World&#8217;s Fair. It was a huge hit at the Fair, and soon was duplicated at every Union Oil station in the American West. In 1967, Union launched its popular antenna balls, giving away more than two million of the styrofoam spheres in a single year. In 2003, ConocoPhillips took over the 76 brand, and soon began removing 76 Balls, much to the dismay of consumers, designers,  architectural historians and Ray Pedersen.</p>

(UPDATE January 2007: ConocoPhillips has begun allocating 76 Balls to museums.)

Finally, we ask that 76 Ball designer Ray Pedersen be allowed to keep a ball for his personal collection.</p>
