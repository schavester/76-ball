<p> 						       <span class="texttitle">On the Ball</span><br />       <span class="textbold"><em><span class="text">How the 76 Ball Was Saved</span></em></span> <br />       <img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/spacer.gif" border="0" alt="" vspace="2" width="1" height="1" /><br />       <span class="textsmall">Story by Arin Greenwood / July 13, 2007</span><br />       <img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/spacer.gif" border="0" alt="" vspace="2" width="1" height="1" />       </p>
<p class="text" align="left">About a year and a half ago, Kim Cooper and her husband, Richard Schave, were driving in Los AngelesÃ¢â‚¬â€perhaps to get some dumplings for lunch, she recallsÃ¢â‚¬â€when at a stop light she happened to look up and find herself shocked by what she saw: changes to the Union 76 gas station on the corner. Big changes. </p>
<p class="text" align="left">The colors of the station were different: The standard orange and blue colors that had been there for as long as Cooper could remember were gone, and they&#39;d been replaced with bright and jarring red. And the station had installed a signÃ¢â‚¬â€a terrible sign, Kim says, a sign that looked like a gigantic, blood-red &quot;blister pack&quot; that aspirin might come in. </p>
<p class="text" align="left">&quot;Now that 76 Station had never had a 76 ball, but it was the standard orange and blue. And suddenly it wasn&#39;t anymore,&quot; Cooper says. &quot;I just sat there festering, going, &#39;That doesn&#39;t look right. That looks really wrong. Did corporate, like, send out the wrong plastic?&#39;&quot; </p>
<p class="text">After lunch, <span class="text">Cooper</span> went home and tried to find out why the gas station looked so different. She discovered that Unocal, a California company and the gas station&#39;s previous owner, had been sold to ConocoPhillips, a Texas company whose corporate color is the red <span class="text">Cooper</span> found so jarring.                          </p>
<p class="text"><span class="text">Cooper</span> found out that ConocoPhillips weren&#39;t just changing the colors of the old Union 76 stations; they were taking down the large, spinning, iconic 76 balls, destroying them. </p>
<p class="text">&quot;I had a gut reaction to the loss that shocked me,&quot; Cooper says. And so she asked her husband, who designs Web sites, to put together a site so she could try to stop ConocoPhillips from taking down the 76 balls. That night, using free software from Drupal.org, Richard created www.savethe76ball.com, and it soon became clear that Kim was not the only person who noticed<span class="text">Ã¢â‚¬â€</span>and resisted<span class="text">Ã¢â‚¬â€</span>the loss of the orange spinning sign. People began signing the petition on the site; a talking (and seemingly depressed) 76 ball made several appearances in the syndicated comic strip Zippy the Pinhead; &quot;And then, next thing I knew, the BBC was doing a story, &#39;Hey, can we have our balls back?&#39;&quot; Cooper says. &quot;And it really just steamrolled from there. &quot; </p>
<p class="text">Why were people so interested in this spinning signage and its seeming demise?   </p>
<p class="text">John Cirillo, who keeps a Web site devoted to gas station signs, remembers when the 76 ball first debuted<span class="text">Ã¢â‚¬â€</span>at the 1962 World&#39;s Fair, in Seattle. &quot;I grew up in Seattle where they had Union 76 stations in good numbers. At that time [in the late 1950s], Union was still using the big round orange disk, which doesn&#39;t look bad either. But in 1962, we went to the Seattle World&#39;s Fair, and the Union 76 exhibit was a sky ride across the fairgrounds. And there at that exhibit, the world saw for the first time those big round orange 76 globes. It made a big impression on me at the age of seven. &quot; </p>
<p class="text">Cooper and her cohort Nathan Marsak<span class="text">Ã¢â‚¬â€</span>they give crime tours of Los Angeles together<span class="text">Ã¢â‚¬â€say their </span>quest to save the 76 ball has a hint of nostalgia to it, too<span class="text">. N</span>ostalgia for a unique California that they think is slipping away, bit by bit. &quot;What&#39;s important about the 76 ball is that it&#39;s very much our version of the sun. California. Beach culture. It&#39;s a big orange orb that spins, for example, in the exact same way the planet spins,&quot; Marsak says. </p>
<p class="text">All these distinctive signs of California, Marsak says, are being taken down by out-of-state companies that don&#39;t have any attachments to the distinctive signage that mean so much to Angelinos. &quot;Small changes do make a difference,&quot; Cooper says. &quot;In the long term, you lose 50 signs, not just 76 balls, and that&#39;s really going to change the landscape. But even just one brand disappearing is kind of one piece of the chorus, one bit of the music that creates this kind of wonderful, groovy, pop world. &quot; </p>
<p class="text">Cooper and Marsak are standing at a Union 76 station at an intersection in Los Angeles that also has a Starbucks, a check-cashing shop, and a place where a person can get accordion lessons. The station&#39;s pumps and shop are outfitted in bright red, but the orange 76 ball is still orange and blue. Cooper goes inside the shop to ask if the ball still spins; a moment later the ball begins rotating, and Marsak says that when he was a kid, he and his family would buy their Halloween pumpkins from a stand across the street from this station. He says that this Union 76 station used to put a jack o&#39; lantern mask over this spinning 76 ball. &quot;What will kids see now? What will they remember?&quot; he says. </p>
<p class="text">More than 3,100 people have signed the &quot;Save The 76 Ball&quot; petition to date. People are buying a lot of &quot;Save the 76 Ball&quot; t-shirts and miniature 76 balls that can be stuck on a car antenna. And ConocoPhillips seems to be making concessions in response. </p>
<p class="text">&quot;We were a little surprised, but thrilled, that our customers wanted us to make the balls available for all to see,&quot; says Philip Blackburn, a ConocoPhillips spokesperson. &quot;We are making the balls available out of our pride in being part of this West Coast tradition and in response to the feedback from our customers. &quot; </p>
<p class="text">ConocoPhillips is planning to keep the spinning signs, but to change them from orange to red. It plans to donate 30 or so of the old orange 76 balls, some to museums such as the American Sign Museum in Cincinnatti and the San Diego Auto Museum, and one to Ray Pederson, the man who designed the original ball for the 1962 World&#39;s Fair. </p>
<p class="text">Ray Pederson, for his part, says he is both pleased and a little bit flummoxed by this outpouring of interest in his 76 ball. Ray remembers that coming up with the idea of the ball was simple. &quot;They wanted signage for a ride at the World&#39;s Fair. The only conceivable thing I could think of was a giant rotating ball. You&#39;d see that big ball all the way across the park,&quot; he says. &quot;I spent so much money on it they almost damn fired me. ConocoPhillips is now replacing the balls with the red color. I said to them that it doesn&#39;t bother me at all, the balls being red. It&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t think they destroyed anything. I&#39;ve done so many designs. It&#39;s OK, it&#39;s cool. The thing lasted for 50, 60 years. That was several lifetimes ago,&quot; he says. &quot;The ball was just part of a milieu of things I did. I designed Yoplait packaging, cigarettes. I didn&#39;t think much of doing things like that then. It was just part of the game. It was my idea to do the antennae balls, too. I&#39;ve got about 15 of those damn antennae balls.&quot; </p>
<p class="text">And yet, Pederson says: &quot;A year ago I was down on Newport beach, coming in on a yacht there from Catalina. And I tell you from 10 miles out we saw the ball, and I said, &#39;Yup, there&#39;s my ball. &#39;&quot; </p>

<p>Nearly one year after we launched our campaign asking ConocoPhillips to reconsider their &quot;destroy all balls&quot; policy towards the historic blue and orange Union 76 Ball gas station signs, the Texas energy giant announced to the Wall Street Journal that they have changed their course. Focus groups held last fall told them what nearly 3000 signers of the Save the 76 Ball <a href="https://www.petitiononline.com/76ball/petition.html" target="_blank">petition</a> have already told us: <strong>people love the 76 Balls, and don&#39;t want them to disappear.</strong> </p>
<p> The 76 Balls that come off their poles are <strong>no longer being smashed</strong> or cut into pieces, but being <strong>preserved for donation to museums</strong> like the American Sign Museum, Petersen Automotive Museum, NASCAR Hall of Fame, Museum of Neon Art and perhaps even the Smithsonian! <strong>And a new type of 76 Ball, colored red rather than orange, will soon be installed at up to 100 gas stations in the west.</strong>  </p>
<p> But there are still good reasons for signing our <a href="https://www.petitiononline.com/76ball/petition.html" target="_blank">petition</a>. We believe that a select few historically and architecturally <strong>significant orange 76 Balls should remain </strong>where they have always glowed and spun, like at William Pereira&#39;s modernist 76 station in Beverly Hills, one of the spheres along Highway One in Malibu, and the station in Marysville, WA where 76 Ball designer Ray Pedersen buys his gas. Also, ConocoPhillips has declared that no private individuals will be able to get a 76 Ball, which will be a disappointment to our campaign&#39;s supporter Michael Madsen. <strong>We respectfully ask that ConocoPhillips reconsider this policy, and present one 76 Ball to the individual who conceived,  designed and hand-painted the first 76 Ball for the 1962 Seattle  World&#39;s Fair: Ray Pedersen.</strong></p>
<p>And most importantly, we ask that ConocoPhillips commit to <strong>pay all costs</strong> <strong>associated with crating and shipping donated 76 Balls to the selected museums</strong>, thus enjoying greater tax benefits and sparing these institutions from having to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars out of their limited budgets in order to receive the gift of the 76 Ball.    </p>
<p> Our heartfelt thanks to everyone who has supported this campaign through 2006 and into 2007. This is inspiring proof that citizens have the power to reach large corporations and inspire positive change.  </p>

<p><strong>Why won&#8217;t ConocoPhillips talk with us?</strong> On 6/15/06, we called ConocoPhillips with a win-win plan to save and preserve some select 76 Balls. We are still waiting for them to call back. Maybe they need to hear from <strong>you</strong>, too. The main number in Houston is 281-293-1000. Ask for <strong>Sylvia Hansen in External Communications</strong> and request that she call Nathan Marsak back and open a dialogue about how to work together to turn this bad publicity around and save some balls.</p>
<p><strong>About our cause:</strong> ConocoPhillips is removing the iconic 76 Balls and replacing them with boring rectangular signs that aren&#8217;t even orange! Our petition and boycott asks that they STOP THIS and leave the remaining 76 Balls on their poles, where they belong. Wanna help?:</p>
<p>1) sign the <a href="https://www.petitiononline.com/76ball/petition.html" target="_blank">PETITION</a>; after adding your name to the list, you can also call ConocoPhillips <a href="https://www.conocophillips.com/contactus/index.htm" target="_blank">DIRECTLY</a>.</p>
<p>2) Join the digg online community and click that you &#8220;digg&#8221; <a href="https://digg.com/software/Can_Drupal_Save_the_76_Ball_" target="_blank">THIS POST</a>. If we can get enough diggs, the topic will rise to the front page and get many thousands of visitors.</p>
<p>3) if your local 76 gas station still has its ball, tell them &#8220;if that ball goes, so does this customer!&#8221; Ask them to turn the ball on if it&#8217;s not lit or rotating. And if your local 76 station has already switched to the liver-colored tombstone sign, don&#8217;t buy gas there and be sure to tell the owner why. (<a href="https://plasticmuse.com/Download.html" target="_blank">DOWNLOAD</a> and print these cards to make it simple.)</p>
<p><img src="https://savethe76ball.honestbleeps.com/files/savethe76card_168.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></p>
<p>4) SPREAD THE WORD: through blogs, email chains, conversation, calls to your favorite talk radio show and letters to the editor.</p>
<p>5) visit our <a href="https://savethe76ball.honestbleeps.com/" target="_blank">FORUM</a> to report existing or missing 76 Balls in your community. Take photos and host them for free right on the Forum.</p>
<p>Consumers have the power to change corporate mistakes. ConocoPhillips will listen if you just speak up!</p>
