										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A reader writes to say: Someone correct me if I am wrong (but I believe I remembered this correctly!) &#8212; the original Union 76 fiberglass BALLS (NOT DISKS) were manufactured ONLY in my hometown of <a href="http://www.galva.com/" target="_blank">Galva, Illinois</a> (population 12[?]).  </p>
<p>Just FYI (a little fun factoid):  one Spring (I was, perhaps, nine years old), Galva was hit by a tornado, and the 76 balls (which were usually neatly lined up in rows OUTSIDE of the factory) were blown all over the town!  My next-door neighboor was gifted by Mother Nature with one, and we rolled around inside of it until the fiberglass worked its nastiness on us!  </p>
<p>I also remember someone a few blocks away cutting one in half for his dog to use as a doghouse!  (I hope the dog escaped the wrath of the fiberglass!)  I may have that wrong (I was young!), but I am fairly certain that Galva is the ONLY place where the infamous orange balls were manufactured!  I&#8217;d like to know more information, if anyone has any!  </p>
<p>Thanks! Sharon (Johnson) Palmer  </p>
<p>P.S. Galva is sister city to Gavle, Sweden!</p>
