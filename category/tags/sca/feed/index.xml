When I wrote this little text about our campaign for the preservation journal of the <a href="https://www.sca-roadside.org/index.html" target="_blank">SCA</a> some months back, I didn&#8217;t think they were going to put it on the cover of Road Notes! </p>
<p>I also didn&#8217;t think the Hermon ball, beloved by Nathan and myself and featured in the photo we sent along, would be GONE by the time it was printed. But so it is. </p>
<p>Walking west on the Sunset Strip last night, I saw a terrible sight, perhaps an omen. A handsome backlit 76 ball on the North side of the street between Fairfax and Crescent Heights was suddenly shut off as my friends and I were enjoying it. It was as if the very sun had gone out. </p>
<p>Save the 76 Ball. It&#8217;s not too late.</p>
