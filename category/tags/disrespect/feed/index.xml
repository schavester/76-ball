										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone wants to know what&#8217;s happening with the 76 Balls that are removed from their poles. Are they stored in a big warehouse? Turned into birdhouses or novelty boats?</p>
<p> Well, based on clues we&#8217;re getting from petroliana enthusiasts and sign historians, the answer is much more chilling. The balls are almost certainly being shattered, because there is no further use seen for them. One source even suggests that ConocoPhillips is requiring station owners to document the 76 Ball&#8217;s destruction with photographs.</p>
<p> Why won&#8217;t anyone at ConocoPhillips discuss this matter with the mainstream press reporters who are calling them? Are they afraid that when we find out what&#8217;s <em>really</em> happening to our beloved 76 Ball, they won&#8217;t be able to contain our rage?</p>
<p>They should be. &nbsp;</p>
