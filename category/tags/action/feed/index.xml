<p><strong>Why won&#8217;t ConocoPhillips talk with us?</strong> On 6/15/06, we called ConocoPhillips with a win-win plan to save and preserve some select 76 Balls. We are still waiting for them to call back. Maybe they need to hear from <strong>you</strong>, too. The main number in Houston is 281-293-1000. Ask for <strong>Sylvia Hansen in External Communications</strong> and request that she call Nathan Marsak back and open a dialogue about how to work together to turn this bad publicity around and save some balls.</p>
<p><strong>About our cause:</strong> ConocoPhillips is removing the iconic 76 Balls and replacing them with boring rectangular signs that aren&#8217;t even orange! Our petition and boycott asks that they STOP THIS and leave the remaining 76 Balls on their poles, where they belong. Wanna help?:</p>
<p>1) sign the <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/76ball/petition.html" target="_blank">PETITION</a>; after adding your name to the list, you can also call ConocoPhillips <a href="http://www.conocophillips.com/contactus/index.htm" target="_blank">DIRECTLY</a>.</p>
<p>2) Join the digg online community and click that you &#8220;digg&#8221; <a href="http://digg.com/software/Can_Drupal_Save_the_76_Ball_" target="_blank">THIS POST</a>. If we can get enough diggs, the topic will rise to the front page and get many thousands of visitors.</p>
<p>3) if your local 76 gas station still has its ball, tell them &#8220;if that ball goes, so does this customer!&#8221; Ask them to turn the ball on if it&#8217;s not lit or rotating. And if your local 76 station has already switched to the liver-colored tombstone sign, don&#8217;t buy gas there and be sure to tell the owner why. (<a href="http://plasticmuse.com/Download.html" target="_blank">DOWNLOAD</a> and print these cards to make it simple.)</p>

<p>4) SPREAD THE WORD: through blogs, email chains, conversation, calls to your favorite talk radio show and letters to the editor.</p>
<p>5) visit our <a href="http://savethe76ball.honestbleeps.com/" target="_blank">FORUM</a> to report existing or missing 76 Balls in your community. Take photos and host them for free right on the Forum.</p>
<p>Consumers have the power to change corporate mistakes. ConocoPhillips will listen if you just speak up!</p>
