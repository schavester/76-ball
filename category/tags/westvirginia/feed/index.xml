<p> 76 Ball fan Mark Turner writes in with a strange discovery he made in his figurative backyard: &quot;I was driving through a nearby town a few days ago and spotted a 76 ball in an unlikely location.  It&#8217;s up on a hill with no station nearby.  I can only assume that somebody just liked it and decided to save it. From most angles when leaves are out, you probably can&#8217;t even see it. I&#8217;ve been past it a hundred times and never spotted it, so I don&#8217;t think the location was chosen to promote a station. Anyway, it&#8217;s in Bluewell, West Virginia behind the Rite Aid pharmacy on Route 52. I&#8217;d been by there many times but hadn&#8217;t noticed it. &nbsp;You can&#8217;t look around much while driving on the busy road but my wife was driving this time and it caught my eye. &nbsp;It&#8217;s near the intersection of routes 52 and 20, behind the Rite Aid. &nbsp;If you try Google Maps, it will place the marker way off, when you search Rite Aid in <span class="st">Bluewell</span>, so ignore their results. &nbsp;<span class="st">Bluewell</span> is small so it&#8217;s easy to find in person.&quot;</p>
<p>More photos are <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/sets/72157594457248701/" target="_blank">here</a>. Thanks, Mark! And if anyone knows why there&#8217;s a 76 sign hidden up among the trees in West Virginia, please chime in in the comments section. </p>
