										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nathan and I were just interviewed by <a href="https://www.700wlw.com/pages/garyburbank.html" target="_blank">Gary Burbank</a> of 50,000 watt monster station <a href="https://www.oldradio.com/archives/stations/cinc/wlwpix.htm" target="_blank">WLW</a> Cincinnati about the campaign to Save the 76 Ball. (Too bad Canada made &#8217;em pot down from half a million watts back in the &#8217;30s!)  </p>
<p>Gary wondered aloud if we&#8217;d been hired by ConocoPhillips to generate controversy after which they could step in and say, &quot;Hey, we didn&#8217;t know how much you loved our balls. Of course we&#8217;ll keep them!&quot; Nathan and I think that would be really neat, and are wondering why the ConocoPhillips payments have yet to arrive in our Swiss bank accounts.</p>
<p> If you&#8217;re near LA today, or like to listen to radio online, tune <a href="https://www.kfi640.com/" target="_blank">KFI-AM 640</a> in at the top of the 4, 5 and 6 o&#8217;clock hours (we&#8217;re not sure exactly which!) and you&#8217;ll hear more from Nathan and myself about what you can do to help Save the 76 Ball, and what the big sunny orbs mean to Southern Californians, and the world. </p>
