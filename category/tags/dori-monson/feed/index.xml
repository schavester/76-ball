<p>A couple of days ago, I was interviewed on Dori Monson&#8217;s KIRO Seattle radio show about the Save The 76 Ball <a href="https://www.petitiononline.com/76ball/petition.html" target="_blank">petition</a> campaign. Hundreds of Dori&#8217;s listeners have rallied to sign the petition, including Dori himself (thanks!). But the most extraordinary thing to come from this interview was an email I received from Ray Pedersen, a man with a very personal relationship to the 76 Ball. Well, let&#8217;s let him tell you about it himself:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /> Kim: &nbsp;It&#8217;s a small world. &nbsp;A friend of mine and fellow alumni of The Art Center School of Pasadena told me you were on a program the other day and sent me this info on you. &nbsp;I am the guy who was creative director in 1955 on the Union Oil account for Young and Rubican Advertising in L.A. &nbsp;I designed the ball for the Seattle World Fair (their SkyRide) and it was so stunning that Fred Hartley wanted it done for all Union Oil Stations. &nbsp;He called it &quot;Pedersen&#8217;s Balls.&quot;&nbsp; It was much fun. &nbsp;I had a small one made so it would just fit in my Beechcraft Bonanza and we went all over the country shooting beautiful scenes and put the ball up on a pole and what do you know?&#8230;. a gas station in front of the magnificent Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, San Francisco Bay Bridge, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /> Here is a snap of me getting the ball ready at the Grand Canyon location. </p>
<p>Save my ball! &nbsp; (have a housefull plus a basketball with the logo) </p>
<p>Regards,<br /> Ray Pedersen</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more from Ray, who is still creatively active at 80, and off to Iceland to brand glacial water for Icelandia PLC!&nbsp;</p>
