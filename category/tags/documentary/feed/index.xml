										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the launch of this campaign, Earl Ma has been one of the 76 Ball&#8217;s most passionate supporters, but he has outdone himself with his latest effort: a series of short films celebrating spinning 76 Balls on display in their natural habitats. Part one: Hawai&#8217;i! </p>
<p>Earl&#8217;s films were all shot in Spring 2006, and more will be posted soon.&nbsp; Anyone with a favorite local 76 Ball and access to DV-quality equipment, please make your own film and we&#8217;ll be happy to share it on this site.</p>
<p>I asked Earl about his intent with creating these shorts, and he replied, &quot;This is the least we can do in terms of &#8216;preserving&#8217; them, in full color/motion, for future generations, because there is no telling how long these specific examples will last.&quot; He is interested in &quot;illustrating in an animated manner why these signs matter&#8211;because of how they fit into the cityscape at large. And they&#8217;re not supposed to be static (of course it doesn&#8217;t help when they&#8217;re not turned on).&quot; His main reason for getting out in the streets with his camera? &quot;Nobody else has taken the initiative to do this!&quot;</p>
<p>Hooray for Earl Ma and for the 76 Ball!&nbsp;</p>
