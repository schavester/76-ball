<p>If you&#8217;ve been wondering, like we have, what&#8217;s become of the 76 Balls that are being pulled down from their poles, here&#8217;s where one of them is: being <a target="_blank" href="https://cgi.ebay.com/Union-76-Light_W0QQitemZ7221333383QQcategoryZ10803QQrdZ1">auctioned on eBay</a>! The seller says it was removed from a Bakersfield race track two years ago. And of course if you win, you have to pick it up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Save the 76 Ball made some new friends in the media yesterday. Check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/fivelive/programmes/upallnight_blog/20060221.shtml">podcast</a> of petition writers Nathan and Kim in the last ten minutes of the BBC&#8217;s Up All Night Blog show, the Daily Telegraph <a target="_blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/02/23/wballs23.xml&#038;sSheet=/news/2006/02/23/ixworld.html">article</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cspnet.com/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=&#038;nm=&#038;type=Publishing&#038;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&#038;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&#038;tier=4&#038;id=67C610CD4F604FC1B84B1C50EB230A46&#038;AudID=B1DB1F916652">piece</a> in the deliciously-named Convenience Store/Petroleum Daily News.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re closing in on 900 signatures on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.petitiononline.com/76ball/petition.html">petition</a>. Will it hit 1000 by the weekend? </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a big blue and orange THANKS to Chris Vallance of the BBC, whose delightful story titled  					<a target="_blank" href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4735280.stm">&quot;Can we have our balls back, please?&quot;</a> sent 30,000 visitors to this website yesterday, and hundreds of international signers to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.petitiononline.com/76ball/petition.html">petition</a>. </p>
<p>The consensus of the comments received yesterday: The 76 Ball is a classic beloved by all who see it, and folks don&#8217;t want it to be removed. They are willing to vote at the pump if ConocoPhillips doesn&#8217;t step back from this rebranding effort and stick with the best gas station signage they&#8217;ll ever have.</p>
<p>Other reporters have become interested in this story.&nbsp; Yesterday I spoke with jounalists from the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> and the <em>Los Angeles Business Journal</em>. And the BBC story inspired a short blurb on the UPI newswire. </p>
<p>And for those of you who&#8217;d like to wear your support of the 76 Ball on your chest or bookbag, our staff artist Phil Goldwhite has created three spiffy, and affordable, designs <a href="https://www.cafepress.com/1947project/1225313" target="_blank">now available in our CafePress shop</a>. May I recommend a nice &quot;Don&#8217;t Let Them Take Our Balls&quot; fridge magnet or a setting ball mousepad?</p>
<p><img border="0" src="https://storetn.cafepress.com/nocache/3/48571343_F_store.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everyone who visits this site has the power to help Save the 76 Ball. Sign the <a href="https://www.petitiononline.com/76ball/petition.html" target="_blank">petition</a> and call or email <a href="https://www.conocophillips.com/contactus/index.htm" target="_blank">ConocoPhillips</a>. Tell your friends. Print out the convenient &quot;keep the ball!&quot; <a href="https://plasticmuse.com/Download.html" target="_blank">cards</a> to hand to your local 76 gas station. Together we can stop false progress and protect our beloved sphere. </p>
