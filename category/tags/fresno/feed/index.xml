										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intrepid 76 Ball Fan J. Eric Freedner has made a startling discovery near Fresno, CA, a discovery that bodes well for those of us who believe ConocoPhillips needs to REPLACE the 76 Balls that they&#8217;ve taken down from their poles. He reports:</p>
<p> Well, I had a feeling I  would find the &quot;missing&quot; 76 balls and&#8230; here they are! </p>
<p><img border="0" src="https://static.flickr.com/47/119375652_89badd6baf.jpg" /></p>
<p>A whole bunch of orange balls is now in the yard of Nelson Sign Service on  Golden State Highway (Old Route 99) in Fresno, California.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="https://static.flickr.com/45/119375653_b338c03311.jpg" /> These weren&#8217;t here a few months ago!&nbsp;&nbsp; What do they plan to do  with them?&nbsp;&nbsp; Spheres take up a whole lot more space than flat signs so  I have a feeling Mr. Nelson won&#8217;t keep them around forever&#8230;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="https://static.flickr.com/43/119375654_51b777b232.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>There are also some flat 76 signs such as this old Fast Break one.&nbsp;  I&#8217;m not sure if the &quot;Fast Break&quot; chain is still in business.&nbsp;&nbsp; Haven&#8217;t  seen any with the new red 76 logos, anyway.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Lots more &quot;petro-jumble&quot; at Nelson&#8217;s but this sums it up as far as the  Balls are concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would think a similar yard exists for the Los  Angeles area, at least for those balls the sign people don&#8217;t clumsily drop to  the ground!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
